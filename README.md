<p id="description">The project DAG_ConsoleApp1 is a task for a job assessment for the Shortest Route Optimizer where the Dijkstra’s Algorithm is used to find the shortest route.</p>

<h2> 🤔 Problem Understanding</h2>

<p>1. Understand the Dijkstra's Algorithm </p>

<p>🚀 Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm | GeeksforGeeks --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba4YGd7S-TY&t=676s</p>

<p>2. Understand the Data Models </p>

*   Hint from function/parameters' name
*   Based on the provided DAG
*   Consider the Graph as G={E, V, w} 👉 Not implemented yet
*   Build the Graph with nodes and their neighbors info (distance) 👉 The uploaded 1st Solution
*   Repeat the update process on the node/distance/parent table, following the YouTube steps for the Dijkstra's Algorithm
*   Code and Debug 👩‍💻

<h2>🛠️ Installation Steps</h2>

<p>1. Build Solution (VS or CLI)</p>

```
dotnet build
```

<p>2. Run the Application and Have Fun</p>
